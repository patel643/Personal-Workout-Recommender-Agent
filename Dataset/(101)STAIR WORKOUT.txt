STAIR WORKOUT

Do 3 - 5 rounds of this, resting 30 sec to a min between each thing as needed

Find a flight of stairs (12 - 15 risers)

2 X two foot hop to top (2 stairs at at time), run back down

10 X 3 stair jumps, run down

Then do these 3 things 6 times
	Wide leg run to top, run down
	Pop squats to top (single stair, jump legs out and in to the top)
	Sprint to top

100 toe taps (like running in place, tap toes on the bottom step; every 10 steps switch and tap the next step up)j

10 Pushup tuck-ins (like the bottom of a burpeeâ€”hands on step, do a pushup then hop feet in and back out and repeat)

20 each side, squatting side to side lunges

40 Mountain climbers (alternate on this between straight ones and cross-body ones each time you do them)

__________________________

End with 1 min ea (straight arm front plank, right side plank, left side plank, reverse plank, forearm plank, hold bottom of a pushup)
