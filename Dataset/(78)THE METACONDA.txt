1.    Dumbbell swing
2.    Blast-off Pushup
3.    Bodyweight squat
4.    Dumbbell piston push-pull
5.    Mountain climber
6.    Hollow-body hold
So in round 1, do 30 seconds of work, followed by 30 seconds of rest for 6 exercises straight. In round 2, do 30 seconds of work followed by 25 seconds of rest. Round 3: 30 seconds of work, 20 seconds of rest. 
Repeat until you’re left with zero rest between exercises.
